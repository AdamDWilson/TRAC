This letter is a formal written request for repairs under Section 32(1) of the BC Residential Tenancy Act, which requires landlords to maintain rental property in a state of repair suitable for occupation. It sets a reasonable deadline for completion and warns that the tenant may seek dispute resolution (repair order and monetary compensation) if the issue is not addressed.
