Dear {{ landlord_name }},

This letter serves as a written request for the following repair(s):

{{ repair_description }}

Section 32(1) of the Residential Tenancy Act states:

> A landlord must provide and maintain residential property in a state of decoration and repair that complies with the health, safety and housing standards required by law, and having regard to the age, character and location of the rental unit, makes it suitable for occupation by a tenant.

I am hopeful that we can resolve the above issue before {{ repair_deadline | formatDate }}. If not, I have the right to apply for dispute resolution through the Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) to ask for a repair order and monetary compensation.

For additional information, please refer to RTB Guideline 1 – Landlord and Tenant Responsibility for Residential Premises or contact the RTB (gov.bc.ca/landlordtenant) at 604-660-1020 or 1-800-665-8779.

Thank you,

{{ tenant_name }}
