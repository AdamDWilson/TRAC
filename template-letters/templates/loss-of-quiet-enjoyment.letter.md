Dear {{ landlord_name }},

Section 28 of the Residential Tenancy Act states:

> **28** A tenant is entitled to quiet enjoyment including, but not limited to, rights to the following:
> - reasonable privacy;
> - freedom from unreasonable disturbance;
> - exclusive possession of the rental unit subject only to the landlord's right to enter the rental unit in accordance with section 29 [landlord's right to enter rental unit restricted];
> - use of common areas for reasonable and lawful purposes, free from significant interference.

My right to quiet enjoyment is being violated in the following way:

As a landlord, you have a legal obligation to make a reasonable effort to correct the situation. Should the matter not be resolved, I have the right to apply for dispute resolution through the Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) to ask for an order that you comply with section 28, as well as monetary compensation for loss of quiet enjoyment. I am hopeful that we can resolve this matter without the need for dispute resolution.

For additional information, please see RTB Policy Guideline 6 - Right to Quiet Enjoyment or contact the RTB (gov.bc.ca/landlordtenant) at 604-660-1020 or 1-800-665-8779.

Thank you,
