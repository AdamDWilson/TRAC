Structure the form like this:
- first ask for tenant and landlord details (see letter for specific fields)
- then ask for the last day of tenancy. Validate that the date is at least 10 days from today.
- ask for the monthly rent amount
- ask for the prorated rent refund amount. Explain that this is the amount the landlord owes for rent already paid for days after the move-out date. For example, if they paid $1500 for the month and are moving out on the 20th of a 30-day month, they would be owed $500 for the remaining 10 days. Calculate total_owed as prorated_rent_refund + monthly_rent.
- ask for the forwarding address where deposits should be returned

Make sure you've collected all fields in the template letter.
