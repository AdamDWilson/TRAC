Structure the form like this:
- first ask for tenant and landlord details (see letter for specific fields)
- then ask for tenancy details (start date and when the tenant would like it to end).  
- then ask if there was a security deposit collected at the beginning of the tenancy.  if yes, ask how much.  calculate the returned amount using a formula that is the principal plus interest calculated by the number of days it was held in a year, compounded annually.  the rates for each year are 2026: 0%, 2025: 0.95%, 2024: 2.7%, 2023: 1.95%.  if the tenancy is outside this range, tell the user to use the calculator at https://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/rtb/WebTools/InterestOnDepositCalculator.html and then enter the returned amount due.
- ask how they want it returned, mail or e-mail, and collect one of either a forwarding mail address or email address.
Make sure you've collected all fields in the template letter.
